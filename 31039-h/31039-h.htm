<blockquote><p>[The Report of the Sweating Committee says that "the inefficiency of
many of the lower class of workers, early marriages, and the
tendency of the residuum of the population in large towns to form a
helpless community, together with a low standard of life and the
excessive supply of unskilled labour are the chief factors in
producing sweating." The Committee's chief "recommendations" in
respect of the evils of Sweating seem to be, the lime-washing of
work-places and the multiplication of sanitary inspectors.]</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHARLES THE FIRST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;It is a very curious thing, but all the trouble was taken out of

<h2>A CHAPTER OF DICKENS UP TO DATE.</h2>

<center>(<i>In which Mrs. Harris, assisted by a Carpet, is the cause of a division
between Friends.</i>)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Gamp's</span> apartment wore, metaphorically speaking, a Bab-Balladish
aspect, being considerably topsy-turvey, as rooms have a habit of being
after any unusual ebullition of temper on the part of their occupants.
It was certainly not swept and garnished, although its owner was
preparing for the reception of a visitor. That visitor was <span class="smcap">Betsey Prig</span>.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp's</span> chimney-piece was ornamented with three photographs: one of
herself, looking somewhat severe; one of her friend and bosom companion,
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, of far more amiable aspect; and one of a mysterious personage
supposed to be Mrs. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>.</p>

<p>"There! Now, drat you, <span class="smcap">Betsey</span>, don't be long!" said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>,
apostrophising her absent friend. "For I'm in no mood for waiting, I do
assure you. I'm easy pleased, but I must have my own way (as is always
the best and wisest), and have it directly minit, when the fancy strikes
me, else we shall part, and that not friendly, as I could wish, but
bearin' malice in our 'arts."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Betsey</span>," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, "I will now propoge a toast. My frequent
pardner, <span class="smcap">Betsey Prig</span>!"</p>

<p>"Which, altering the name to <span class="smcap">Sairah Gamp</span>, I drink," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>,
"with love and tenderness!"</p>

<p>"Now, <span class="smcap">Sairah</span>," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, "jining business with pleasure, as so
often we've done afore, wot is this bothersome affair about which you
wants to consult me? <i>Are</i> you a-goin' to call me over the Carpet once
more, <span class="smcap">Sairey</span>?"</p>

<p>"Drat the Carpet!" exclaimed Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, with a vehement explosiveness
whose utter unexpectedness quite disconcerted her friend.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> it Mrs. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>?" inquired Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes, <span class="smcap">Betsy Prig</span>, it <i>is</i>," snapped Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, angrily, "that very
person herself, and no other, which, after twenty years of trust, I
never know'd nor never expected to, which it 'urts a feeling 'art even
to name her name as henceforth shall be nameless betwixt us twain."</p>

<p>"Oh, shall it?" retorted Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, shortly. "Why bless the woman, if
<i>I</i>'d said that, you'd ha' bitten the nose off my face, as is your
nature to, as the poick says."</p>

<p>"Don't you say nothink against poicks, <span class="smcap">Betsey</span>, and I'll say nothink
against musicians," retorted Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Oh! then it <i>was</i> to call me over the Carpet that you sent for me so
sudden and peremptory?" rejoined Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, with a smile.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Drat the Carpet!!!</span>" again ejaculated Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, with astonishing
fierceness. "Wot do <i>you</i> know about the Carpet, <span class="smcap">Betsey</span>?"</p>

<p>"Why nothink at all, my dear; nor don't want to," replied Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>,
with surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh!" retorted Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, "you don't, don't you? Well, then, I <i>do</i>, and
it's time you did likewise, if pardners we are to remain who 'ave
pardners been so long."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span> muttered something not quite audible, but which sounded
suspiciously like, "'Ard wuck!"</p>

<p>"Which share and share alike is my mortar," continued Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>; "that
as bin my princerple, and I've found it pay. But Injin Carpets for our
mutual 'ome, of goldiun lustre and superfluos shine, as tho' we wos
Arabian Knights, I cannot and I will not stand. It is the last stror as
camels could not forgive. No, <span class="smcap">Betsey</span>," added Mr. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span>, in a violent
burst of feeling, "nor crokydiles forget!"</p>

<p>"Bother your camels, and your crokydiles too!" retorted Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, with
indifference. "Wy, <span class="smcap">Sairey</span>, wot a tempest in a teapot, to be sure!"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gamp</span> looked at her with amazement, incredulity, and indignation.
"Wot!" she with difficulty ejaculated. "A&mdash;tempest&mdash;in&mdash;a&mdash;Teapot!! And
does <span class="smcap">Betsey Prig</span>, my pardner for so many years, call her friend a
Teapot, and decline to take up <span class="smcap">Sairey's</span> righteous quarrel with a Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Harris</span>?"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. <span class="smcap">Prig</span>, smiling more scornfully, and folding her arms still
tighter, uttered these memorable and tremendous words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wy, certainly she does, <span class="smcap">Sairey Gamp</span>; <i>most</i> certainly she does. Wich I
don't believe there's either rhyme or reason in sech an absurd quarrel!"
After the utterance of which expressions she leaned forward, and snapped
her fingers, and then rose to put on her bonnet, as one who felt that
there was now a gulf between them which nothing could ever bridge
across.</p>

<h2>NELLIE AT THE SODGERIES.</h2>

<center>(<i>Another Legend of the Royal Military Exhibition.</i>)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lady once more left her frame in the Club Morning Room.</p>

<p>"So I was wrong," she murmured, as she wended her way towards the now
familiar spot. "Poor <span class="smcap">Nellie</span>, after all, was <i>not</i> forgotten. I am glad
of it,&mdash;very glad indeed!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 15%">
<a href="images/244b.png">
<img src="images/244b.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>And the flesh tints of Sir <span class="smcap">Peter Lely's</span> paint-brush brightened, as a
smile played across the canvas features.</p>

<p>"I' faith! the Military gentlemen are gallants, one and all! To be sure!
Then how would it be possible that the foundress of a hospital should be
overlooked? And one as comely as myself!"</p>

<p>So, well pleased, she journeyed on. As she reached the river, there was
quite a crowd,&mdash;people were coming by rail, and boat, and omnibus. It
was quite like the olden days of the Exhibitions at South Kensington.
She passed through the turnstiles, and then found the cause of the
excitement. There were all sorts of good things. A gallery full of
pictures, and relics of battles ancient and modern, a museum of
industrial work, a collection of everything interesting to a soldier. In
the grounds were balloons, and fireworks, assaults at arms, and the best
military bands. At length the Lady from the frame in the Club Morning
Room stood before a portrait showing a good-natured face and a comely
presence.</p>

<p>"And so there I am! And in my hands a model of the Hospital hard-by!
'Gad zooks!' as poor dear <span class="smcap">Rowley</span> used to say, I have no cause for
complaint! I thank those kind hearts who can find good in
everything,&mdash;even in poor <span class="smcap">Nellie</span>!"</p>

<p>And, thoroughly satisfied at the treatment she had received at the
Sodgeries, Mistress <span class="smcap">Nell Gwynne</span> returned to her haunt in the Club
Morning Room.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">A Glee Quartette.</span>&mdash;Welcome to the Meister Glee Singers. Mr. <span class="smcap">Saxon</span>, in
spite of his name, is by no means brutal, though he might be pardoned
for being so when he sees his colleague Mr. <span class="smcap">Saxton</span> suiting everybody to
a T. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hast</span> has just as much speed as is necessary, and the fourth
gentleman should be neither angry <span class="smcap">Norcross</span>, since he always sings in
tune. 'Tis a mad world, my Meisters, but, mad or not, we shall always be
glad to hear your glees.</p>

concentrated agony of forty-eight continuous hours of wrenching your

<p>It has been finally settled that Mr. <span class="smcap">Phil Gorman</span>, who will be remembered
in connection with the catering department at all the public dinners
held of late years in Sloshfield, is to be the next incumbent of the
highest municipal office in that prosperous borough. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gorman</span> is a
daughter of the celebrated local poet, <span class="smcap">James Posh</span>, whose verse still
occasionally adorns the <i>Sloshfield Standard</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A remarkable incident is stated to have taken place at Lady B&mdash;&mdash; 's
fancy dress ball. A gentleman, wearing the gorgeous costume of a
Venetian Senator of the <i>renaissance</i> period, somewhat awkwardly
entangled his spurs in the flowing train of a beautiful <i>d&eacute;butante</i>,
dressed to represent Diana the Huntress. Some of those in the immediate
vicinity of the ill-used goddess aver that she was distinctly heard to
say, "Pig!". Those who know her better declare, however, that, with her
usual politeness, she merely remarked, "I <i>beg</i> your pardon." Hence the
misconception, which is certainly pardonable.</p>

<hr />

<p>The trees in the Park are now assuming their brightest verdure. It is
interesting to note that the number of sparrows shows no signs of
diminution.</p>

<hr />

<p>Excellent subject Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> has chosen for his serious
opera&mdash;<i>Ivanhoe</i>. It is now finally settled that the part of <i>Rowena</i>
will not be entrusted to Mr. <span class="smcap">Herbert Campbell</span>. It is whispered that the
great effect will be the song of <i>Isaac of York</i>, magnificently
orchestrated for fifteen Jews' harps, played by lads all under the age
of twelve. They have already commenced practice under the eye of Sir
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, who himself is no unskilled performer on the ancient lyre of
<span class="smcap">Jubal</span>.</p>

<h2>A RUM CUSTOMER.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<a href="images/245a.png">
<img src="images/245a.png" width="100%" alt="A RUM CUSTOMER" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> have bin so jolly busy lately at the "Grand Hotel," and a reel
grand Hotel it is too, that they wanted sum assistence in the werry
himportant line of Waiters; so they werry naterally sent for me, and in
course I went, and a werry nice cumferal place it is for ewerybody, both
Waiters and Wisiters, and I can trewly say as I aint had not a singel
complaint since I have been here.</p>

<p>Well, one day a young Swell came a sauntering in, about 4 o'clock, and
wanted to know if he cood have a lunch for a gentleman, and in the
hansomest room as there was in the house. Of course I was ekal to the
ocashun, and told him, yes, he coud, and not only in the hansomest room
in that house but in the hansomest room in Lundon, and I at wunce showed
him into our Marble Pillow Room, which I coud see at a glarnce made a
werry deep impression on his mind, which I was not at all surprized at,
for it is about as near a approach to Paradise as you can resonably
expect so werry near the Strand.</p>

<p>So I sets him down at a sweet little round table, and I puts a lovely
gold candlestick on it, with two darling little cherubs a climing up it,
jest as if they was a going for to lite the candle, and then he horders
his simple luncheon, which it was jest a cup of our shuperior chocolate
and two xquisite little beef and am sandwitches, and wile he eat and
drank 'em he arsked me sech lots of questyuns as farely estonished me.
Such as, how much did the four Marbel Pillows cost? So I said, about 200
pound, for I allers thinks as an hed Waiter should be reddy to anser any
question as he is arsked, weather he knos anythink about it or not.</p>

<p>Then he wanted to know where we got all our bewtifool flowers from, and
I told him as we had 'em in fresh every morning from the South of France
along with our Shampane, which was made a purpose for us by the most
sellebrated makers, and consisted of two sorts, wiz.: dry for the
higneramuses and rich for the connysewers. So he ordered a bottle of the
latter, and drunk two glasses of it, and then acshally made me drink one
two, and sed as it was the finest as he had ewer tasted. He then asked
me what made us line all the room with such bewtifool looking glass, and
I told him as it was by order of most of the most bewtifoolest Ladys in
Lundon, who came to dine there wunce or twice every week. So he said as
how he shood drop in now and then to see 'em, for he thort as they gave
a sort of relish to a good dinner. He then got up, and saying as he
didn't want not no Bill, he throwed down a soverain and saying, "I shall
allus know where to cum to when I wants a reelly ellegant lunch, in a
reelly ellegant room, and to be waited on by a reelly respectful
Waiter," went away.</p>

<p>And now cums the strangest part of the hole affair, for presently in
rushes our most gentlemanly Manager, and he says, says he, "Do you know,
<span class="smcap">Robert</span>, who that was as you've bin a waiting on?" "No, Sir!" says I.
"Why it's no other than the young &mdash;&mdash;" But wild hosses shan't tear the
name and title from me, as I was forbid to menshun it; but all I can say
is, that if it was known when he was a coming next time, there wood be
sich a crowd to see him as ewen our bewtifool Marble Pillow Room
wouldn't hold.</p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

No. XII.&mdash;THE POOR LADY BOUNTIFUL.</center>

<p><span class="smcap">Poverty</span> is commonly supposed to be a bar to all generosity and enjoyment
of life. Perhaps this may be true of a certain class. But there is a
kind of genteel and not unfashionable poverty with regard to which it is
mainly false. A poor lady, for instance, who is afflicted with an
overmastering charitable impulse, and is blessed with energy, will use
this bar of poverty as a lever with which to move the bounty of her
friends, in order that she herself may appear bountiful, and, as a rule,
her efforts in this direction will be crowned with a success that would
be phenomenal, if it were not so common. The history of her earlier
years is easily written. Whilst still a child, she begins a collecting
career, by being entrusted, on behalf of a church building fund, with a
card divided into "bricks," each brick being valued at the price of
half-a-crown. Her triumphs in inducing her relations and their friends
to become purchasers of these minute and valueless squares of cardboard
are great, and the consideration she acquires on all hands as a
precocious charitable agent is very acceptable even to her childish
mind.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">
<a href="images/249.png">
<img src="images/249.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>Her profession having thus been determined, she devotes herself with an
unflagging ardour to the task of diminishing the available assets of
those with whom she may be brought in contact. Her parents, who are not
overburdened with riches, look on at first with amusement, and
afterwards with the dismay which any excess of zeal always arouses in
the British breast. Their protests, however, fall upon deaf ears, and
they adopt an attitude of severe neutrality, in the hope that years and
a husband may bring wisdom to their daughter.</p>

<p>This does not save them from being made involuntary sharers in her
charitable iniquities. Her father wakes one morning to find himself
famous to the amount of one pound ten, contributed under the name of "A
Cruel Parent," to the Amalgamated Society for the Reform of Rag-pickers,
and his wife at the same time is made indignant by the discovery that
she figures for twelve-and-sixpence, as "A Mother who ought to be
Proud," in the balance-sheet of the United Charwomen's Home Reading
Association. Further inquiry reveals the fact that the former sum
resulted from the sale by the daughter to an advertising Old Clothes'
Merchant of two of her father's suits, which, although they had seen
service, he had not yet resolved to discard; and the result is the
dismissal of the family butler, who had connived in the transaction. The
twelve-and-sixpence had been formed gradually by the accumulation of
stray coppers and postage-stamps, which her mother was accustomed to
leave about on her writing-table, without the least intention that they
should be devoted to charity. The parents expostulate in vain. The
consciousness that she has diverted to objects, which she believes to be
admirable, money that might have been unworthily spent, steels the heart
of their daughter against their remonstrances, nor can she be induced to
believe that, in thus taking upon herself to interpret or to correct the
intentions of her parents, she has done wrong.</p>

<p>Matters, however, are thus brought to a crisis. Her home becomes
unendurable to her, and she accepts the offer of marriage made by a
subordinate, and not very highly paid official, in one of the
Departments of the Civil Service. Her parents pronounce their blessing,
and rejoice in an event which promises them an immunity from many
annoyances.</p>

<p>The marriage duly takes place, but it is soon evident that the poor Lady
Bountiful will not allow her change of condition to make any difference
to the vigour and persistency of her charitable appeals. She continues
the old firm and the old business under a new name, and takes advantage
of her independence to enlarge immensely the field of her operations. No
bazaar can be organised without her and as a stall-holder she is
absolutely unrivalled. Missions, teas, treats, penny dinners, sea-side
excursions, the building of halls, the endowment of a bishopric, the
foundation of a flannel club, all depend upon her inexhaustible energy
in begging. Nor is she satisfied with public institutions. Private
applicants of all kinds gather about her. Destitute but undeserving
widows, orphans who have brought the grey hairs of their parents to the
grave, old soldiers and stranded foreigners batten upon her capacity for
taking advantage of her friends. For it must be well understood that the
restricted limits of her husband's means and his parsimony prevent her
from contributing anything herself to her innumerable schemes except a
lavish expenditure of pens and ink and paper with which to set forth her
appeals. Yet in this she is a true altruist. For she knows and tells
everybody how delightful and blessed it is to give, and accordingly in
the purest spirit of self-denial she permits her friends to dispense the
cash, whilst she herself is satisfied with the credit.</p>

<p>Like a mighty river, she receives the offerings of innumerable tributary
streams, which lose their identity in hers, and are swept away under her
name, to be finally merged in the great ocean of charitable effort. Who
does not know, that it was mainly owing to her indefatigable efforts,
that the new wing was added to the Disabled District Visitors' Refuge,
and who has not seen at least one of the many subscription lists to
which "per Mrs. So-and-So" invariably contributed the largest amount? Is
it not also on record that at the reception which followed the public
opening of this wing, when the collecting ladies advanced to deposit
their collections at the feet of presiding Royalty, it was the Poor Lady
Bountiful who brought the largest, the most beautifully embroidered and
the fullest purse? It was felt on all hands, that "the dear Princess"
had only done what an English Princess might properly be expected to do,
when she afterwards, under the inspiration of the cunning Vicar,
showered a few words of golden public praise into the palpitating bosom
of the champion purse-bearer.</p>

<p>And thus her time is spent. When she is not organising a refuge she is
setting on its legs a dinner fund, when she has exhausted the patience
of her friends on behalf of her particular tame widow, she can always
begin afresh with a poverty-stricken refugee, and if the delights of the
ordinary subscription-card should ever pall, she can fly for relaxation
to the seductive method of the snowball, which conceals under a cloak of
geometrical progression and accuracy, the most comprehensive uncertainty
in its results. One painful incident in her career must be chronicled.
Fired by her example, but without her knowledge, a friend of hers from
whom she is accustomed to solicit subscriptions, steps down to do battle
on her own account in the charitable arena. And thus, when next the Poor
Lady Bountiful makes an appeal in this quarter on behalf of a Siberian
Count, whom she declares to be quite a gentleman in his own country, she
is met by the declaration, that further relief is impossible, as her
friend has a Bulgarian of her own to attend to. Thus there is an end of
friendship, and both parties scatter dreadful insinuations as to the
necessity for an audit of accounts. Eventually it happens that a rich
and distant relation of her husband dies, and leaves him unexpectedly an
income of several thousands a-year. Having thus lost all her poverty,
she retires from the fitful fever of charitable life to the serene
enjoyment of a substantial income, and awaits, with a fortitude that no
collector is suffered to disturb, the approach of a non-subscribing and
peaceful old age.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>Hard Luck</i>, by <span class="smcap">Arthur &agrave; Beckett</span>, begins a trifle slow, but works up to
an exciting climax, of which the secret is so profoundly kept, up till
the very last moment, that not the most experienced in sensational plots
would discover it. Capitally managed. It is one of the Arrowsmith
Series, and a genuinely artistic shilling shocker.</p>

<p><i>A Black Business.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hawley Smart</span>. Uncommonly smart of him bringing it
out just at this time, when the talk everywhere is about the Slave
Trade, the struggle for Colonial life, <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, and the Very Darkest
Africa. There's Black Business enough about. Smart chap <span class="smcap">Hawley</span>.</p>

<p>The only thing I've to say against the <i>Remarks of Bill Nye</i>, in one
volume, says the Baron, is the size of the book, which is as big as a
family Bible. Nowadays, when busy men can only snatch a few seconds <i>en
route</i>, the handy volume is the only really practicable form of
literature. I'd rather have three small pocketable volumes of <span class="smcap">Bill Nye's</span>
essays and stories than this one cumbersome work, which, once on the
shelf, runs a pretty good chance of being left there. The majority of
<span class="smcap">Bill Nye's</span> sayings are very amusing, and one of his short papers shows
that the humorist can be pathetic on occasion without falling into mock
sentiment. It is published by <span class="smcap">Neely</span>, of New York, and, if reduced in
bulk, the <i>Remarks of Bill Nye</i> ought to do very well here, even among
those who, for want of familiarity with American slang, do not keenly
appreciate American humour. The Baron does appreciate it when it is
genuine American humour, but when the peculiar style is only copied by a
journalistic <span class="smcap">'arry</span>, with whom the stupidest and most vulgar Yankeeisms
pass for the highest wit, simply because they are Yankeeisms, then for
this sort of imitation the Baron has no criticism sufficiently severe.</p>

<h2>OUT AND ABOUT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;I have been about, according to your instructions, and I have come
back with a mixed notion that somewhere in the dawn of history the Queen
of <span class="smcap">Sheba</span>, scantily dressed, and attended by her black Chamberlain, drove
out on a four-horse parcel-post van to see an exhibition of paintings on
china at Messrs. <span class="smcap">Howell and James's</span>. It is perfectly true that in the
course of my wanderings I had some champagne, but <i>not a drop of
chicken</i>. Consequently, I have brought my critical faculty home with me
entirely unimpaired. But to business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">E. J. Poynter</span> has painted a noble picture of the meeting of <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>
and the Queen of <span class="smcap">Sheba</span>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">T. McLean</span> exhibits it at 7, Haymarket. I
once saw a picture of this Queen on an ancient corner-cupboard; that was
in early childhood, and the Queen of those days was a very Dutch Lady.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Poynter's</span> is quite unlike that one; in fact, she is extremely
beautiful. But why is she overcome? <span class="smcap">Solomon</span> might have been pardoned for
blushing when he saw her, but he takes it quite as a matter of course.
The black Chamberlain is evidently not a lord, otherwise he would have
been more careful about his Queen's dress. There are harps, peacocks,
golden lions, luscious fruits, monkeys, marble steps, and gorgeous
pillars, to complete the picture. Curiously enough, the other ladies do
not seem to care for the newly-arrived Queen. Bravo, <span class="smcap">Poynter</span>! A great
picture!</p>

<p>After this I hurried to the painted China Exhibition at <span class="smcap">Howell And
James's</span>; very delicate, very graceful, and very refined. "<i>A Wild
Corner</i>" by G. <span class="smcap">Leonce</span>, "<i>Blue Tits</i>" by Miss <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>&mdash;sure to make her
Mark(is),&mdash;two landscapes by <span class="smcap">A. Fisher</span> (who needs no rod) struck me
particularly, but did not hurt me much. And so to the wilds of Finsbury
(14, Castle Street) where Messrs. <span class="smcap">McNamara</span> were exhibiting the Postal
Vehicles to be used at the Penny Postage Jubilee Celebration. I've
already ordered two four-horse parcel vans, three two-horse, and two
one-horse mail-carts for my private use, <i>and have told Messrs. M. to
put them down to you, Sir</i>. I couldn't resist it. They said it would be
all right. Please make it so. I am told, that no <i>females</i> are employed
in these vehicles. Another injustice. I should like to ride in a lovely
red carriage for ever.</p>

<h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</center>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> has been lately some racing at Kempton and various other places,
as to which, I ought perhaps to say a few words. Not that I acknowledge
a right in anyone to dictate to me how and when I shall notice matters
connected with the turf. The Bedlamites who mouth and gibber about
horses and their owners, as if they were in the constant habit of living
on terms of familiar intimacy with the aristocracy, instead of being, as
they probably are, the dumpling-headed parasites of touts and
stable-boys, are entitled only to the contempt of every decent man who
knows anything about what he professes to understand. At any rate, they
have mine. My knowledge of the Kempton Course dates back at least fifty
years. To be sure, it was not at that time a racecourse, but was mostly
ploughed fields and thickets. But if the anserous and asinine
mooncalves, whose high priest is Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>, suppose that that fact in
any way weakens the authority with which I may claim to speak on the
subject, I can only assure them, that they prove themselves fit inmates
for the various asylums from which they ought never to have been
withdrawn. I never thought much of <i>Philomel</i>. Ten years ago, I
observed, with regard to this animal, "<i>Philomel</i> must be watched. There
is no knowing what a course of podophyllin and ginger might not do.
Failing that, I should feel inclined to say, buncombe." Mr. J. says,
this was a different mare. What of that? In turf matters the name is
everything, and I am therefore justified in citing this as one of the
most extraordinary instances of prescience known to the turf world.</p>

<p><i>Megatherium</i>, I notice, has many admirers. As a horizontal bar, or
possibly as a clothes-line, he might have merits, but as a horse, I must
confess, he has little to recommend him. When <i>Loblolly Boy</i> cantered
home for the East End Weight-for-age Welter Handicap, I said that the
son of <i>Rattlesnake</i> could make mince-meat of all his rivals. Since then
he has made for his owner &pound;5,000,000 in added money, at an initial
expense of twopence halfpenny for saveloys and onions, a combination of
which this splendid animal is particularly fond. <i>Loblolly Boy</i> was by
<i>Rowdy</i> out of <i>Hoyden</i>, and his pedigree mounts up to <i>Sallycomeup</i>,
<i>Kissmequick</i>, and <i>Curate on Toast</i>, whilst in the collateral line he
can claim kinship with <i>Artaxerxes</i> and <i>Devil's Dustpan</i>. In the
Margate Open Sweepstakes, he ran second to <i>Daddy</i>, when the sea was as
smooth as an old halfcrown. If there had been wind enough to blow out a
wooden match, he must have won in a common hand-gallop.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 12.</i>&mdash;"If a shutter be closed in the
daytime," said <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, a little abruptly, as we walked down to
House to-day, "the stream of light piercing through the crevice seems to
be in constant agitation. Why is this?"</p>

<p>Hadn't slightest idea. Suggested Right Hon. Gentleman had better give
notice of question.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 20%">
<a href="images/251b.png">
<img src="images/251b.png" width="100%" alt="Can&#39;t a-bear verbosity" /></a>
<h4>"Can't a-bear verbosity."</h4>
</div>

<p>"I can tell you why," he proceeded, with unwonted perturbation. "Because
little motes and particles of dust, thrown into agitation by the
convective currents of the air, are made visible by the strong beam of
light thrown into the room through the crevice of the shutter. That's
just the way with us, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>; <i>a</i> is the hatred of Government by the
Opposition, the strong desire to take our places; <i>b</i> is the convective
currents of air which agitate the political atmosphere; <i>c</i> is the
Compensation Bill, the strong beam of light which, thrown into House
through crevice opened by <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>, makes the whole thing clear. Don't know
whether <i>I</i> am; but if you reflect on the situation, you'll find there
is much in what I say. We were going along moderately well. Irish Land
Bill, of course, a rock ahead; everyone takes that into account.
Suddenly <span class="smcap">Jokim</span>, spoiling for a fight, goes and invents this Compensation
Bill, quietly hands it over to <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> to work through, and all the
greasy compound is in the devouring element. Seems a pity we could not
leave the tolerably satisfactory undisturbed. Now we're in for it.
Meetings out-of-doors; opposition in-doors; prospect of getting on with
ordinary work of Session receding into distance."</p>

<p>Good deal of truth in what <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> says. House crowded to-night;
full of seething excitement. <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> moved Second Reading of
Compensation Bill; <span class="smcap">Caine</span> moved Amendment, eliminating principle of
compensation. Capital speech; would have been better if it had been half
an hour shorter. Between them, <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> and <span class="smcap">Caine</span> occupied nearly three
hours of sitting, leaving five hours for the remaining 668 Members.</p>

<p>"This is not debate," protested <span class="smcap">Shaw-Lefevre</span>, sternly! "it is preaching;
why cannot a man be concise? Concision, if I may coin a word, is the
soul of argument. My old friend <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span> used to say to me, '<span class="smcap">Shaw</span>, what I
admire about <span class="smcap">Lefevre</span> is his terseness. If you want a man to say in
twenty minutes everything that, from his point of view, is to be spoken
on a given subject, <span class="smcap">Shaw-Lefevre</span> is the man.' That was, perhaps, a too
flattering view to take; but there's something in it, and it makes me,
perhaps naturally, impatient of a man who wanders round his subject for
an hour and a half."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Compensation opened.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"Heard something about good man struggling with adversity,"
said Member for Sark, looking at <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span>. "Nothing to goody goody man
struggling with manuscript of his speech."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> certainly a melancholy spectacle. Evidently had spent his
nights and days in preparation of speech on Compensation Bill; brought
it down in large quarto notes. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> glanced across House with
sudden access of interest; thought it was a copy-book; Speech evidently
highly prized at rehearsals in family circle.</p>

<p>"I think," said <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span>, complacently, "before I sit down I shall show
you that the view I take is correct."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>This remark interjected early in speech; proved rather a favourite.
Whenever <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> got more than usually muddled, looked round nervously
at empty Benches, nodded confidentially to Mace, and remarked, "Before I
sit down I think I shall show you&mdash;&mdash;" What it was he meant to show, no
one quite certain. <span class="smcap">Elliot Lees</span>, who followed, assumed with reckless
light-heartedness of youth, that he meant to show before he sat down,
that the more public-houses licensed, the less drunkenness.</p>

<p>"That," said <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span>, with unaccustomed flash of intelligent speech,
"was exactly the reverse of what I undertook to show the House."</p>

<p>Would have gone on pretty well only for (1) the Accountant, and (2)
<span class="smcap">Sinclair</span>. Whatever it was <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> was going to show before he sat down,
he had fortified himself in his position by opinion of a sworn
Accountant. Conversations with this Accountant set forth at length.
<span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> appears to have been kept by the Accountant in state of
constant surprise. "Let's take two places in the country," he said, in
one of the more lucid passages. "Well, there are only 360 public-houses
in Leeds. Sheffield has 400 public-houses in proportion to population,
whereas Bradford hasn't 160. Well, I was so much struck with this, that
I wanted to know whether there were any reasons for it. So I applied to
the Accountant&mdash;<i>without telling him my object</i>&mdash;which really was," he
added, nodding quite briskly at the Mace, "to know whether there was
more drunkenness in Leeds or Sheffield. He said at once, that Leeds was
the most. Then I said to the Accountant 'I don't care about your
individual cases, let's take the average. Let's take Birmingham.'"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 15%">
<a href="images/252a.png">
<img src="images/252a.png" width="100%" alt="but not clear" /></a>
<h4>"&mdash;&mdash; but not clear."</h4>
</div>

<p>Afterwards Blackburn and Stockport were "taken"&mdash;"As if they were goes
of gin," said the Member for Sark; <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> turning over papers, which
appeared to have got upside down, recited heaps of figures. These struck
him the more he studied them. Anonymous Accountant seemed to have
brought him completely under a spell. His highly respectable appearance,
his evident earnestness, his accumulated mass of figures, his engagement
of the Accountant, the tone of his voice, his general attitude, all
conveyed impression that he was really saying something intelligible and
useful. The few Members present honestly endeavoured to follow him;
might have got a clue only for <span class="smcap">Sinclair</span>.</p>

<p>At end of first half-hour <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> began to show signs of distress.
<span class="smcap">Sinclair</span> thought he was signalling for water; prepared to go for glass;
something wrong; <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> violently agitated; nodding and winking and
pointing to recess under bench before him. House now really excited.
Began to think that perhaps the Accountant was hidden down there. If he
could be only got up, might explain matters. <span class="smcap">Sinclair</span> sharing general
agitation, dived under seat; reappeared attempting to secrete small
medicine bottle, apparently containing milk-punch; drew cork with
difficulty; poured out dose, handed it to <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span>. <span class="smcap">Rathbone</span> gulped it
down; smacked his lips; much refreshed; evidently good for another hour.</p>

<p>"I said to the Accountant," he continued, "if the Magistrates of
Sheffield had indiced these lorcences&mdash;I mean endorsed those
licences&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Off again, wading with the Accountant knee-deep in figures from Leeds to
Sheffield, back to Birmingham, across to Liverpool, on to York, with
occasional sips of milk-punch. A wonderful performance that held in
breathless attention few Members present to hear it.</p>

<p>"It is magnificent," said the Member for Sark; "but it isn't clear."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rathbone's</span> great speech on the Licensing Question.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Quite lively for Wednesday afternoon. At outset,
apparently nothing particular in wind. Irish Members had first three
places on Agenda, but that nothing unusual. Prospect was, that Debate on
their first Bill, appropriating Irish Church Fund to provide Dwellings
for Agricultural Labourers, would occupy whole of Sitting; be divided on
just before half-past five. To make sure, <span class="smcap">Akers-Douglas</span> issued Whip to
Ministerialists, urging them to be in their places as early as four.</p>

<p>"Never know what the Bhoys will do," he said, sagely. "Like to be on the
safe side. Division at five, so be here at four."</p>

<p>The Bhoys came down in great force at one o'clock; only a score or so of
Ministerialists visible. Fox rose to move Second Reading of Bill. Good
for an hour if necessary. Long <span class="smcap">John O'Connor</span>, that Eiffel Tower of
patriotism, ready to Second Motion, in a discourse of ninety minutes.</p>

<p>"May as well make an afternoon of it," he says, gazing round the
expectant but empty Benches opposite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fox</span> just started, when happy thought struck Irish Members. If they
divided at once, before Ministerial majority arrived, could carry Second
Reading; so Brer <span class="smcap">Fox</span> doubled, and in ten minutes got back home. Long
<span class="smcap">John</span> folded himself up, till casual passer-by might have mistaken him
for <span class="smcap">Picton</span>. Conservatives, not ready for this man&oelig;uvre, dumfounded.
Division imminent; only thing to be done was to make speeches till four
o'clock and majority arrived. Everybody available pressed into service.
<span class="smcap">Charles Lewis</span>, coming up breathless, declared that "promoters of Bill,
wished by a side-stab in the wind of the Government"&mdash;he meant by a
side-wind&mdash;"to stab the Measure on the same subject the Government had
brought forward."</p>

<p>That was better; though how you stab by a side-wind not explained.
Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> threw himself languidly into fray. Talked up to quarter
past three; majority beginning to trickle in, <span class="smcap">T. W. Russell</span> moved
Adjournment of Debate. Defeated by 94 votes against 68. Irish Members
evidently in majority of 26. Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>, with eye nervously watching
door, wished that night or <span class="smcap">Blucher</span> would come. Neither arriving, stepped
aside, letting Irish Members carry their Bill; which they did, amid
tumultuous cheering.</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence, I assure you," Prince <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> said, quoting <i>Mr.
Toots</i> when he inadvertently sat down on <i>Florence Dombey's</i> best
bonnet. "They may carry their Bill, but we'll take the money."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Members out-man&oelig;uvre Government.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Second Reading of Compensation Bill carried at early hour
this morning, after dull debate. Morning Sitting to-day for Supply.
Duller than ever. Dullest of all, <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> on Treasury Bench in charge of
Estimates.</p>

<p>"Yes, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he said, in reply to sympathetic greeting, "I <i>am</i> a little
hipped; situation growing too heavy for me. Patriotism all very well;
public spirit desirable; self-abnegation, as <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> says, is the
seed of virtue. But you may carry spirit of self-sacrifice too far. Read
my speech at dinner to <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>, of course? Put it in the right light,
don't you think? We Dissentient Liberals, as they call us, are the
Paschal Lambs of politics; except that, instead of being offered up as
sacrifice, we offer up ourselves. Still there are degrees. <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>
given up something; <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span> chucked himself away; <span class="smcap">James</span> might have
been on the Woolsack. But think of me, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, and all I've
sacrificed. Four years ago a private Member, adrift from my Party; no
chance of reinstatement; not even sure of a seat. Now Chancellor of the
Exchequer, with &pound;5000 a-year, and a pick of safe seats. Too much to
expect of me, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>; sometimes more than I can bear;" and <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> hid his
face in his copy of the Orders of the Day, whilst <span class="smcap">Theodore Fry</span> looking
on, was dissolved in tears.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supply.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Complaints</span> are often made as to the non-appreciation of jokes by those
to whom they are addressed. A Correspondent sends us on this subject the
following interesting remarks:&mdash;"I have made on an average ten jokes a
day for the last six years. Being in possession of a large independent
income, I could have afforded to make more, but I think ten a day a
reasonable number. I find that, as a rule, the wealthy and highly-placed
have absolutely no appreciation of humour. The necessitous, however,
show a keen taste for it. The other day a gentleman, whom I had only
seen once, asked me for the loan of a sovereign. I immediately made six
jokes running, and was rewarded by six successive peals of laughter. I
then informed him I had no money with me, and left him chuckling to
himself something about an Eastern coin of small value, called, I
believe, a dam."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Narrow Escape of an R.A.!</span>&mdash;Everyone knows that a Critic is one, who
would, professionally, roast and cut up his own father; but that some
Critics go beyond this, may be gathered from the fact of the Art-Critic
of the <i>Observer</i>, in one of his recent reviews of the Academy, having
thus expressed himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Poynter's</span> flesh is never quite to our liking,"&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Heavens! What a dainty cannibal is this Critic! But how lucky for Mr.
<span class="smcap">Poynter</span>.</p>
